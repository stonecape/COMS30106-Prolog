# COMS30106-Prolog
## Part 1: Getting around
You need to be able to navigate a space populated by obstacles using Prolog. Every move depletes your energy and so you frequently need to visit a charging station for a top-up. 

## Part 2: Identity crisis
You know you are a famous actor or actress at the forthcoming Academy Awards ceremony, but you have forgotten who you are. Oracles can give you clues about your identity. 

## Part 3: Identity crisis, continued
Now you need to adapt Part 2 to work in the grid world. 

## Part 4: Optional
You will need to navigate a dynamic world, as some of the obstacles, oracles and charging stations may be moving around, and the world may contain additional agents. It is likely that your previous A\* search will fail whenever the agent finds its planned path blocked by a moved object or another agent. So the minimum I'm looking for here is robustness in your search and the ability to re-plan when necessary. Being able to work with multiple agents is a bonus.
